		html: <p>I have always struggled with uncertainty. If I try to ignore it, I get tight through my upper back, which then builds into neck tightness and eventually into cramps at the base of my skull. By the time this has happened, I can barely think or see, and lose days to dealing with the pain and recovery.</p><p class="callout">So it's fair to say that I'm pretty bad at uncertainty, and that I need to fix that.</p><p>I just had an illuminating experience while planning where to live. Recently, my partner and I had been living out of our van in Byron Bay, and we just decided that we are ready for a proper home. Not buying yet, but staying in a community which we can longterm consider buying in.</p><p>We love the concept of Byron Bay but dislike the reality of property in this area, so it wasn't a given that we'd stay here. </p><p>We spent days and days talking, hypothesising, weighing the choice between Sydney and Byron, and eventually settled on Sydney. This was an exhausting process. We were both thrilled to have made a decision, and to be getting started on the next phase. And to never have to talk about it again.</p><p>Until a few hours ago, Byron is back in lockdown and the whole plan is on pause. Our beautifully crafted, thoroughly planned plan... needs to be replanned. What a waste of energy and stress.</p><p>If I honestly reflected, I suspect that a minority of my plans actually work out, so why am I so obsessed with having one? I think the answer is related to fear, and wanting to make the safest choice possible. </p><p>Seems like a great way to miss out on unexpected opportunities to me tbh. Sounds like I need to get my fear and my optimism back into partnership. And hopefully never waste another day to self-induced neck cramps! </p>
