I have a few clues but my brain is really playing hide-the-cheese on this one with me.</p><p><span class="callout">It's currently fixating on almost anything, and my mind won't stop whirling.</span></p><p>Topics such as a plot arc from what I've watched recently, fake coding suggestions for some made up problem with a project of mine, real thoughts about real choices for projects, thinking about the decision we're making about where to live.. its all fair game and all equally stressful to me.</p><p>The rub is that this is making it so hard to identify what my sticking point it and being to solve it. Trying to meditate or clear my mind has worked temporarily, but as soon as I lapse the thoughts are back, spiralling away about just about anything. It's as though the tension is causing the fixation, and the fixation is adding to the tension.</p><p>I have a few clues. Moving into a flat, and the uncertainty of where and when. Starting a new job on Monday and the major change that that brings. Starting a huge project this week during my week off, knowing it won't be finished but still hoping it will be.</p><p>I kinda suspect its this last one since I've been dreaming about coding and waking up semi-panicked (that's a weird thing to write down, good to acknowledge though). I love this vocation, it lets me do and learn so many amazing things, but it is so hard to switch off of, since its work and hobby, so I give myself very little downtime from it.</p><p>Gotta learn how to not burn out...</p><p>Suggestions from the internet about short-term interrupting the fixation that I think I'll test out (there were many many more):</p><ol><li><strong>Thought stopping.</strong> Interrupting the fixation with a strong thought, perhaps even the word <em>STOP </em>or performing a self check-in, to break the cycle and choose not to dwell on it. </li><li><strong>Mantras. </strong>Repeating a mantra to send your subconscious mind a message that you prefer, something as simple as "You're doing okay".</li><li><strong>Write about it.</strong> Doing that one now.</li><li><strong>Distract myself / Relax. </strong>Stop coding for a bit, stop learning, stop "growing". Take some downtime to truly unwind. The pain makes this hard since nothing is relaxing, but maybe the right kind of distraction will help.</li><li><strong>Avoid triggers. </strong>No Hacker News, no Reddit, nothing which makes me want to stop doing 4 or that is just involving myself in other people's stress for fights / worries.</li></ol><p>Later, looking at how to help stop myself from continuing this loop.</p>
