		html: <p>I've been thinking about a quote a lot recently because of ongoing neck cramping and headaches. </p><p><span class="quote">Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. Say you’re running and you think, ‘Man, this hurts, I can’t take it anymore. The ‘hurt’ part is an unavoidable reality, but whether or not you can stand anymore is up to the runner himself. </span></p><p><span class="quote-attr">Haruki Murakami, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</span></p><p>I start hurting, then I start getting upset that I'm hurting and the emotions cascade into hopelessness &amp; desperation for it to end. Which only adds to my emotional load and makes things worse.</p><p>For as long as I can remember, whenever doing something painful (e.g. long distance running, or climbing) I have repeated a simpler version of this quote to myself, <strong>"suffering is optional"</strong>. Its a reminder that I can always choose my response to a challenging situation.</p><p>I might be in pain, but it is my decision to act as though it is the worst thing thats ever happened to me. It helps me to remember that I can choose not to suffer.</p>
