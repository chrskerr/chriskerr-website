		html: <p>After my recent bout of <a data-prefetch-href="/self-induced-burnout" href="/self-induced-burnout">neck cramping</a>, it's clear to me that my current hypothesis for the cause of this pain (and therefore my management techniques) are poor.</p><p>It's always related to stress. More stress, more chance of pain. I'm not new to stress, and have historically experienced much much higher levels of stress than today, yet I've never reacted this strongly. The cramping started early 2021, so something is new and can hopefully be fixed.</p><p>The primary differences are:</p><ol><li>Learning to code</li><li>Living in our van</li></ol><h4>The Van</h4><p>Location uncertainty is definitely an additional stress (<em>hypothesis:</em> the extra stress reduces my general resilience, which allows a much stronger reaction to lower levels of additional stress), but we are already looking for a place to live, so this one is hard to experiment on.</p><h4>Coding</h4><p>Coding is a more interesting change to me. It's both my job and my hobby, and I'm very guilty of never taking days off. To my conscious brain, stopping my work-coding and beginning my hobby-coding is a totally fresh activity. It's energising, it's learning new technologies or tools, and I can easily spend an extra 20+ hours a week working on hobbies. </p><p>To my body, though, there is probably no difference. It's just more hours thinking about hard problems, burning energy working out solutions, perhaps at an even higher rate than the work week, since I'll often be attempting to expand what I know There is research, trial &amp; error, learning, etc. Growth is very demanding.</p><p><span class="callout">Sometimes during the most interesting or demanding moments of these projects, the task at hand is all that I'm capable of thinking about until it is finished. Literally. </span></p><h3>Experiment</h3><h4>Aim</h4><p>Attempt to identify if certain behaviours increase my risk of neck cramping, so that I can begin to avoid them.</p><h4>Hypothesis</h4><p>I'm perpetually in a state of mid-to-high grade mental fatigue from taking no days off per week, and it has severely diminished my reserves, meaning my stress reaction is exaggerated. </p><p>If I begin taking proper downtime, then I will experience fewer neck cramps.</p><h3>Experiment</h3><p>Coding may only be done between 8am Monday morning and 6pm Friday night. </p><p>Exceptions are allowed for the following, provided that they are infrequent or truely important.</p><ul><li>Special circumstances, such as something critical needs fixing or a schedule shift on a particular week </li><li>Small amounts of very-low-effort coding, such as a CSS fix on this site</li></ul><h4>Analysis</h4><p>TBA</p><p>I'm not yet sure how I will track progress and confirm if this has actually helped. I am currently considering a spreadsheet with days being "tagged" based on what I did. I need to do more research on this bit.</p>
