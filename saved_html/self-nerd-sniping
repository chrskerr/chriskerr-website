		html: <p>When I first read <a target="_blank" href="https://xkcd.com/356/">this comic</a>, years before starting to code, I could not even remotely picture the type of person that this would apply to. Let alone being that type of person. </p><p>But I had a moment of clarity the other day when I was talking to Kate (my partner and rubber duck) about some problem I was working on. I just trailed off into my own mind. I'd thought of an interesting approach to something entirely else and was mentally exploring that pathway. She tells me that I do this all the time, especially if I'm working on something that I'm passionate about.</p><p>This was a fun revelation for me. On one hand, I've found a vocation which enables me to challenge myself and be this intensely focused which I absolutely love. On the other, I suspect that it's a big contributor to my <a data-prefetch-href="/self-induced-burnout" href="/self-induced-burnout">painful stress levels</a>.</p><p>I know burnout levels are high in programming, for a huge variety of reasons, including the fact that nothing is ever truly finished.</p><p>So it would be extremely unsurprising to me to learn that I was never switching off, and that this was destroying my ability to relax. Leading to frequent neck pain and probably a shorter life. Oops!</p>
