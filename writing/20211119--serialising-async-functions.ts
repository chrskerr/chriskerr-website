So it turns out that I am way less versed in Javascript packages than I thought that I was, and didn't realise that [Async](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async) existed...

So instead of using their queue function I created my own.

I needed to create a helper which would ensure that a function would only execute one-at-a-time to assist with time ordering of changes emitted by the my [editor](/editor/n). Changes are sorted server-side when saved to the database but this can only help live-subscribers if delivery is queued so that there is actually something to sort.

After all that, I published a wrapper which serialised my function (plus a bunch of other stuff, like data transforms), and wanted to share it with anyone who might benefit ðŸ™‚

An extended version of the below can be found at [Async Function Serializer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async-function-serializer), but this was the core code!

\`\`\`ts
type Queue<InputType, ResultType> = {
	resolve: ( data: ResultType ) => void,
	input: InputType,
}[]

function serialise<InputType, ResultType>( 
	functionToSerialise: ( input: InputType ) => ResultType, 
): ( input: InputType ) => Promise<ResultType> {

	const queue: Queue<InputType, ResultType> = [];
	let isRunning = false;

	async function run () {
		isRunning = true;

		const current = queue.shift();
		if ( current ) {
			const result = await functionToSerialise( current.input );
			current.resolve( result );
		}
		
		if ( queue.length ) await run();
		else isRunning = false;
	}

	return async function ( input: InputType ): Promise<ResultType> {
		return await new Promise<ResultType>( resolve => {
			queue.push({ resolve, input });
			if ( !isRunning ) run();
		});
	}; 
}
