I have been doing a great deal of work with myself to understand and influence the way that I react to situations. Perhaps similarly to many people, I find that I can be doing the calmest of activities (laying in bed reading, for example) and out of the blue I'm hit with a wave of total stress or anxiety.

This isn't a favourite habit of mine.

I've been looking at trauma, mental habits, diet, meditation, breathing, more, to help me to find the magic bullet which will stop this reactivity, and this is my personal summary of what I have remembered to date. I hope that some lessons translate well to others.

*Guiding intention: The sudden escalations of anxiety in inappropriately stressful situations are the target symptom to resolve. The unpleasantness of these moments is both the motivation to fix the deeper problem and are identifiers of internal distress.*

I can split this goal a little further into reducing the frequency of escalations, reducing the time to de-escalation and reducing my concious involvement in de-escalation.

The reduction of the frequency of escalations may seem like the entire goal, but I believe that it can only ever be a component of a properly functioning anxiety response. The moments serve a functional purpose within our lives since they are a loud alarm yelling that something may not be right, and a properly functioning alarm is a good thing.

In an ideal system, the emotional response will trigger focus and physical action; the concious brain will identify if the threat is resolved, unresolved or an overreaction/mistake; and then can de-escalate back down to baseline as appropriate. 

For myself, I escalate in situations which bear no resemblance for physical or social risk and I remain escalated for far too long. This causes stress, anxiety, etc, to linger through too great a percentage of my day.

I'll write more about these three aspects in follow-ons, but at a high level my current approach is as follows.

My mistaken escalations are almost certainly due to something that I have heard, seen or experienced in my past. The current moment somehow resembles a previous one in which I was (or felt) threatened. My brain thinks it is doing me a favour by highlighting the risk but the reality is that I need to re-train it to no longer see these moments as risky. This is much easier said than done since the cause could be ANYTHING. This'll be a super hard aspect of growth.

I have experienced stress for so long that my baseline no longer feels like stress. To reduce the time to de-escalation I need to learn to more rapidly identify escalation (say by noticing tension in my jaw or shoulders) and to build the skill of consciously de-escalating. Every minute that I allow myself to remain escalated after a false alarm is reinforcing that this was actually a correct response; if I became stressed and allowed myself to remain so, then surely it must have been the correct response.

And reducing my concious involvement in de-escalation is probably a combination of habit creation and skill improvement. If I create a habit of de-escalating immediately, then there will be times that it kicks in automatically. There are also lots of unknowns in this domain, but my initial focus is to break the habit of remaining escalated and allow my natural mental processes to take back over.
