	<h2>About me</h2>

		<p>👨‍💻🚴‍♂️🏃‍♂️☕️⛰️🏝️</p>

		<p>
			Hey there, I'm Chris - a fullstack software engineer with a blend of
			technical and business expertise.
		</p>

		<p>
			I've been a software engineer for four years professionally, plus
			over a decade of other business experience, including a number of
			years in technical sales roles.
		</p>

		<p>
			In my roles I have been responsible for code architecture,
			stakeholder communications, feature planning, driving the
			development of large features, and coaching junior developers. My
			business experience allows me to communicate effectively with
			non-technical stakeholders and with other engineers.
		</p>

		<p>
			In my personal life I like to mountain bike, head out trail running
			with a halfway mark coffee break, and read books with another
			coffee.
