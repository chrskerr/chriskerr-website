		<p>👨‍💻🏄🏃‍♂️☕️⛰️🏝️</p>

		<p>
			Hey there, I'm Chris - a fullstack software engineer with a blend of
			technical and business expertise.
		</p>

		<p>
			I've been a software engineer for four years professionally, plus
			over a decade of professional business experience, including a
			number of years in technical sales roles.
		</p>

		<p>
			I am confident with both the technical and business aspects of
			engineering. In my roles I have been responsible for code
			architecture, feature planning, driving the development of large
			features, and coaching junior developers. My business experience
			allows me to communicate with the broader team and allows me to take
			a more senior approach to my engineering.
